# About Me

Hi, I’m **Francis**, a hands-on full-stack developer with a passion for building **practical, clean, and high-performance web applications**. I focus on **SvelteKit**, **TailwindCSS**, and **MongoDB**, but I’m always exploring new tools and technologies to solve problems efficiently.

This portfolio is more than just a showcase of my projects — it’s a **reflection of my approach to development**: simplicity, functionality, and clarity. Each project here represents a problem I’ve solved, a skill I’ve refined, and my philosophy that **good software is both usable and maintainable**.

# Purpose of This Portfolio

1. **Showcase My Work:** Display real projects that highlight my skills in front-end and full-stack development.
2. **Demonstrate My Process:** Show not just the finished product, but how I approach problems and build solutions.
3. **Connect With Others:** Offer a place for potential collaborators, employers, or clients to learn about me and reach out.

# My Approach

I believe in **learning by doing**. I prefer hands-on experimentation, breaking things apart, and understanding how each part works — then putting it back together better. My portfolio is a direct extension of this mindset: clean, structured, and functional, with a focus on **real-world usability**.

# Philosophy

> “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”

Every project here reflects my commitment to **building software that works, looks good, and makes life easier** — both for users and developers.
